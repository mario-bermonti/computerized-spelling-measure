* This is mspelling!

  mspelling is a Spanish spelling test developed for research on spelling
  skills. mSpelling was design to be as easy to administer and as flexible as possible
  to facilitate conducting research on spelling skills.

  It presents the words to be spelled by playing audio files and the participant writes the word
  using the keyboard.

  At the end of the session, mspelling saves the results to a CSV file, which is supported
  by most popular spreadsheet software these days like Excel.

  The software is developed using the Python programming language v3.

  *Better documentation is coming very soon!*

  *Note:* Because mspelling is used mostly for research with elementary-school
          children the interface is adapted in a format appropriate for them and
          may not be appropriate for other age groups. However, you can customize
          how mspelling looks and "feel" very easy if you know a little about [[https://www.python.org/doc/][python]]
          and the [[https://kivy.org/doc/stable/][Kivy]] framework (python library).

* Installation
 1. Install poetry ([[https://python-poetry.org/docs/][instructions]])
 2. [[https://github.com/mario-bermonti/mspelling/archive/master.zip][Download mspelling]] or clone it into your computer using git
 3. Open mspelling's directory using terminal or cmd ([[https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/mac-terminal-commands-cheat-sheet/][check this cheatsheet]] for more info)
 4. Run =poetry install= to install mspelling and all its dependencies. You can see the list
    in the =pyproject.toml= file

 *That is it! mspelling is ready to be used!*

* Description
  - mspelling has a very simple interface and walks the user through a series of
    screens. The sequence is as follows:
    + Welcome message
    + Login screen: Participants enter the id assigned to them
    + Get ready message
    + Spelling activity screen: Participants hear the words and type them. mspelling
      presents all the words specified in the stimuli file (see below).
    + Goodbye message: Results are saved and the participants can press any key to
      end the session.
    
* Usage
  - run the main.py file using python (=python3 main.py=) and mspelling will start
  - There are two types of sessions in mspelling: practice and experimental sessions
    + The session is considered practice if no participant id is provided.
      In this case, mspelling will read the words from
      =stimuli/words/practice.csv=. 
    + The session is considered an experimental session if a participant id is provided.
      The id can contain letters, numbers, and symbols. In this case,
      mspelling will read the words from =mspelling/stimuli/words/experimental.csv=.
  - In both cases, mspelling expects:
    + the audio for each word to be in the =mspelling/stimuli/audio/= folder.
      All audio files must be in =wav= format.
    + The text stimuli must be in a column named =word= of the CSV file.
  - At the end of the session, mSpelling stores the results in the
    =mspelling/results= folder. The name of the file will be identified with
    the participant's code (blank for practice sessions) and the current
    date and time.

    *mspelling comes with a short demo version of 5 Spanish words. Go ahead and
    try it! Just use mspelling like a practice session (no user id).*
